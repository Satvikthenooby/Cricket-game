# Cricket-game
 This is a book cricket game. You must have played it in your childhood. The player can bat for 2 overs with 12 wickets in hand. Toss and team announcement is also added to make it realistic. Over all this is a nice project to do as a student. I will try to do the same using oops(as i am a beginner so it may take time). Please review my script and correct me.
In the file cricketoops.py, I have did the same thing using object oriented programming. please correct me if there are any corrections.
