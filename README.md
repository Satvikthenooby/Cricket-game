Hey guys, we all have played that book cricket game in our childhood. It's just like that. I made this project in two ways- one with oops and other without oops. 
I would suggest this project to student of class 12th and python beginners. Instructions are given inside cricket.py file. Please feel free to improve my project. Any effort would be appreciated.
